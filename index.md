# Overview

We typically meet on the last Wednesday of the month from 8:30 to 9:30am in the OHRC conference room (Hatfield Research Center room 0405, take the "G" elevator). Coffee is provided.

If you're a member of the OHRC, you should automatically recieve announcements via the OHRC staff listserv. If you aren't a member of the OHRC or wish to recieve the announcements at a different email, contact the organizers.

The format of the club is flexible. Talks typically are 10 minutes (followed by 5 minutes for discussion), 20 minutes (followed by 10 minutes for discussion) or 45 minutes (followed by 15 minutes for discussion).  However, deviations from this format are encouraged if it fits what you'd like to talk about.

At the meetings we have a wide range of presentations and discussions.  You can present an idea for an experiment you'd like to run (even if you have no preliminary data), show your pilot data, or get feedback on a grant proposal or paper you're submitting.

We are also looking into the idea of organizing mock study sessions where we find 2-3 people to review your proposal before the meeting and the remaining participants act as the rest of the panel.  However, this requires advance prep as you need to have a draft ready several weeks before the proposal is due. If you are interested in this, please contact one of the organizers.
