Tomorrow, Wednesday, November 14 we will have two talks:

    Name (30 min.) - Type - Title.

We will provide coffee. We will meet at 8:30am in the OHRC conference room (HRC 0405, take the "G" elevator in the Hatfield Research Center). Everyone (including faculty) are encouraged to attend.

Our website has more information about upcoming meetings (https://bburan.github.io/OHRC-data-club/upcoming.html - note the new URL) and we have a listserv for people who don't currently receive these announcements. If you know of someone who'd like to be added, please have them contact
me.
